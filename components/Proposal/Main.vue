      AS I was busy interacting with GPT to gain help with a programming project of mine, I came to
      relize that GPT has a proper understanding of a plethora of data structures used in the realm
      of programming and datascience. One such data structure is "JSON" standing for
      <span class="italic text-slate-600">JavaScrip Object Notation</span>. JSON has been the
      standard file format for transferring textual information between web servers an browsers for
      a while now. The purpose of JSON is to provide a standardized way to represent and structure
      data in an intuitive way for both humans and machines. Interestingly, it is possible to
      <span class="text-teal-500 underline">define pateints' characteristics</span> using this
      format which is well-recognized by GPT. As compared with typing multiple paragraphs denoting a
      pateint's clinical condition, this approcach facilitates communication with in a smooth and
      consitent manner . This will not only save us from typing a story into GPT's input but also
      paves the way of editing previous queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the following example of a JSON file definging a patient refrerring to the emergency
      depratment with right lower quadrant abdominal pain :

      The majority of the existing literature on chatGPT has focused on assessing its performance
      with exam-like questions which in reality may not reflect the clinical scenarios phicians are
      confronted wth. Our interest is whether chatGPT can reliabliy perform as a decision support
      system for in across various disiplines. take the follwoing example:
    </p>
    <div class="">
      . Information is represented in an object oriented where a combination of key-value pairs are
      used to organize data. The hierarchical nature JSON uses, similar to dictionaries in Python or
      objects in JavaScript, to organize data. The data is stored in a hierarchical format, which
      means that it can have nested structures. Each key-value pair is separated by a colon, and
      multiple pairs are separated by commas.
    </div>
    <div class="">
      following the same pattern and extending it to a clinical setting, we can easily describe a
      patient with the following data structure
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl text-teal-500">Proposed Method</h2>
      <p>
        In order to truely grasp the details and inner working of GPT, it might be rational to
        extend the testing to all of the recognzed major deciplines in clinical medicine.

        Question: How consitent is GPT in answering a clinical question which are well within its
        capabilities? In other words how likely are we to repeatedly recieve an answer to a clinical
        question from GPT? In this case we are intrested to know GPT's
